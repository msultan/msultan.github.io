## Introduction
Congratulations on getting your new job! It must have been a journey given all the criterion that [you had consider](https://msultan.github.io/post/20240421_job_hunting_p1/) to find this spot. Very likely now you will get an official offer letter that details your offer, and you might start to read things like ISOs or RSUs and 4% 401K match in there. This blog post is a short explanation of what to expect and how to think about whether or not what you are getting is "fair", "poor", or "generous". This blog post is more geared towards privately held biotechs though a lot of what I write will be applicable for public companies too. 

Pro tip: I am NOT a tax lawyer or financial advisor. Ths is my attempt to summarize what I found and wish I had learned earlier. It is neither guaranteed to be be correct nor is it complete. 

Pro tip: You SHOULD always negotiate your initial offer. Most places have wiggle room in many dimensions of compensation, and this will be the only time that you will have the leverage to do so. 
 
 #Pro tip: A lot of companies will try to force you to make a decision on evaluating the offer and accepting ASAP! Slow down and fully understand and possibly benchmark what you are being offered. This is the only time in the process where you have the power to negotiate. 

In general your total compensation (TC) will be a combination of salary, bonus, equity and benefits. Different companies weight these differently and depending on your needs, you might decide on a lower salary with better benefits or higher equity if you believe in the product etc. 

## Ways companies might compensate you: 
1. Base pay
2. Bonus percentage
3. Equity 
4. 401K matching 
5. Starting bonus/moving expenses 
6. Employee stock purchase program  
7. Perks 


### Base pay
In general, I think its absolutely atrocious that we as an industry do not have something as awesome as [levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/?compare=Google,Facebook,Salesforce&track=Software%20Engineer) to evaluate our job offers. While the companies generally tend to use compensation surveys to set their internal bands, its not always clear where you fall on the band. The leveling across industry is also incredibly varied so it becomes incredibly difficult to think about where you fall. Evaluating your base pay is easiest in locations such as california and new york where employers are now required to post the salary bands for their roles. One option could be to look through the bands for their nearest competitors and see where you fall. Another option is to rely on [h1b data](https://h1bdata.info/index.php?em=merck&job=&city=&year=2023) to get some reference numbers on the salary ranges. A third option is to potentially look through reddit's biotech [salary survey](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G0FmJhkOME_sv66hWmhnZS5qR2KMTY7nzkxksv46bfk/edit) to get an idea. For small startups, usually their base pay is at or below market but they will give you a lot more equity (see below on how to think about that) to compensate. 

### Bonus percentage
Most offers come with a target bonus percentage. This is a lump sum bonus paid annually. The exact value that you get is dependent on several factors including the company's performance, their remaining runway, and your individual performance. The percentage values depend on a variety of factors including company size, your leveling etc. Usually, there is less negotiation room here since these are fixed percentages set for a large number of folks within the company. 

### 401K matching
Several companies might offer a 401K match. What this usually means is that the company will match your 401K contributions up to a certain percentage amount of your base salary as long as you contribute that amount too. Usually there is a cap on the absolute amount (though not always). For example, a company offering a 4% match on a 100K salary could be an additional $4000 added to your 401K tax free. In my opinion, this is a often a great deal. However, I would recommend chatting with your 401K administrator to make sure you can maximize the match amount. 

### Starting bonus/moving expenses 
Usually if you are moving states or are lucky enough to be in a highly required role at the right time, you can negotiate for an additional starting bonus. 

### Perks
The utility of perks really depends on the individual but anything from onsite gym facilities, paid lunches/snacks/coffee, home setup stipend, public transport stipend, IVF treatment etc can be part of the package. How much each any/each of those matter to you will likely depend on your personal circumstances. For example free breakfast and lunches can be an additional 5-10K if you go into the office everyday or 0 if are fully remote. 

### Equity 
I have left the equity component last because imo it is one of the trickiest things to evaluate. I would recommend talking to an actual tax professional to understand some of the nuances of your options and restricted stock units (RSU). RSUs are shares that are issued by the company while options are a promise that allow you to purchase those shares at a later date at a specified price. Options come in differing flavors such as incentive stock options (ISOs) and non-qualified stock options (NSO). These options have DIFFERENT tax liabilities and require careful handling. I cannot do full justice to explaining the nuances of this topic so I highly recommend reading through the [Holloway guide](https://www.holloway.com/g/equity-compensation/preview) to understanding equity. The full book is $25 but you can get an older free version [here](https://github.com/jlevy/og-equity-compensation). This blog contains a lot of detailed knowledge on how to think about equity, options etc. It also goes into far greater detail on tax implications of various options etc.  

However, you will have several basic questions regarding your equity that I will try to answer below. 


### How do I evaluate my equity offer?
A lot of companies will start by giving you a rather mysterious number (say 50K) of options or RSUs, and thats it. In the case of options, you will be provided with their strike price. At this point, you have to reply back and ask for a few extra pieces of information. 
1. In order to evaluate how fair the equity offer is, you need to know how many fully diluted outstanding shares there are. This will tell you what fraction of the company you own. A lot of times, executives and HR get REALLY squeamish about providing this. However, you need to know this to think through how fair your equity component is. You cannot know if you own 1% of the company or 0.0000001% unless someone provides you with the denominator in that equation. 
2. Their free market value (FMV) AND preferred share price. These should be available in the last 409A valuation that the company performed. Usually the FMV is below the preferred price though the latter is used for company valuation. The difference between these gets smaller as the company matures and gets closer to an IPO. 
3. Preferred share multiplier/liquidation preference. This is a piece of information that you are VERY unlikely to get but a steep multiplier can dramatically reduce your chance of a successful exit. See this [article](https://carta.com/learn/equity/liquidity-events/liquidation-preferences/) for more details. 


### How much equity is fair?
Equity levels are again rather mystical and will very likely depend on the company size/stage/funding. For very early companies [Holloway's guide]( https://medium.com/holloway-guides/typical-employee-equity-levels-from-the-holloway-guide-to-equity-compensation-ca8b4181008e) provides some benchmarks though I believe those numbers are wildly inflated by tech. Biotechs are capital intensive and thus they almost never have employee option pools at this level.    

### How much could my options or RSUs be worth?
Again, this depends on a lot of future scenarios that are basically impossible to predict. You could be holding on to stocks in the next Regeneron or its completely worthless. One tool that I have found useful is plugging in potential scenarios in Front's [options evaluation tool](https://comp.data.front.app/). To evaluate your exit scenarios, you could plug in the market caps of various biotechs in the [xbi](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/funds/spdr-sp-biotech-etf-xbi). Just remember, this is index tracks only around 150 biotechs from [1000s](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-022-01496-8.pdf). Usually, you should think about exits of around 500M, 1B, 3B, 5B, and 10B+ to get a range for what you will hopefully eventually make. 

### Are there any special tax exemptions I should know about? 
Again, you should be talking to a tax expert here. However, at very early stages, you can often file a 83b election with the IRS. This allows you to pay taxes on your equity at the current free market value and that allows you to trigger your capital gains clock much earlier. However, you need to file this election within 30 days of the equity assignment so if this is something that you think is applicable to you, I highly recommend doing it asap. The difference could be hundreds of thousands of dollars down the road. 


### How long will it take to the exit event? 
This will depend on the company runway, its valuation, the quality of its scientific data, and state of the public markets. A lot of companies remain private for 7-10 years before going public. This exit timescale can get exacerbated by external circumstances. For example, in 2024, we have been seeing a major slowdown in companies going public for several years now due to the higher central bank rates and continued inflation. The potential for such a long time horizon should factor into your calculations above. The same payout in 2 vs 10 years might mean very different things to different folks. One gotcha to remember is that, due to financial regulations, your options/shares are locked for 6 months after the IPO date so your horizon is actually slightly longer. 

However, companies will sometimes do a secondary market offering for their employees even though they are still private. This allows the employees to get liquidity for their vested stocks at their most recent valuations. This is rarer in biotech but more common in larger private tech companies. 

#### Golden handcuffs and taxes 
A rather common scenario in joining startups is the golden handcuffs problem. This happens rather frequently in highly valued private companies. This can proceed in a couple different ways. One way is that if you have been issued lot of expensive options (i.e high strike price) you will have to pay for those options AND all taxes (i.e FMV - strike price) out of pocket. This can be tens, if not hundreds, of thousands dollars. Often times, biotechs will have a 3month clause in their contracts for exercising these options. I.e you will have to come up with the entire amount during that time or you will forfeit your vested shares (yes even if those are years old).  In a publicly traded enterprise, this is not an issue because you can immediately sell a fraction of the corresponding options/shares to cover the cost of the options/shares. In a private enterprise, you are outta luck. 

## Final thoughts 
Do not accept the first offer you are given! There is almost always wiggle room along several dimensions in every offer given to a candidate. Depending on your needs, status, and seniority, you might be able to negotiate a lot of them. And again, once you have signed the offer, try to not think about it too much. Practice self care, maintain a healthy work-life balance, and gratitude for being able to work in an amazing industry that impacts so many patient lives. In the end, it will all be okay.
