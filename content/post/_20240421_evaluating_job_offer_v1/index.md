## Introduction
Congratulations on getting your new job! It must have been a journey given all the criterion that [you had consider](https://msultan.github.io/post/20240421_job_hunting_p1/) to find this spot. Very likely now you will get an official offer letter that details your offer, and you might start to read things like ISOs or RSUs and 4% 401K match in there. This blog post is a short explanation of what to expect and how to think about whether or not what you are getting is "fair", "poor", or "generous". This blog post is more geared towards privately held biotechs though a lot of what I write will be applicable for public companies too. 

Pro tip: You SHOULD always negotiate your initial offer. Most places have wiggle room in many dimensions of compensation, and this will be the only time that you will have the leverage to do so. 

In general your total compensation (TC) will be a combination of salary, bonus, equity and benefits. Different companies weight these differently and depending on your needs, you might decide on a lower salary with better benefits or higher equity if you believe in the product etc. 

## Ways companies might compensate you: 
1. Base pay
2. Bonus percentage
3. Equity 
4. 401K matching 
5. Starting bonus/moving expenses 
6. Employee stock purchase program  
7. Perks 


### Base pay
In general, I think its absolutely atrocious that we as an industry do not have something as awesome as [levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/?compare=Google,Facebook,Salesforce&track=Software%20Engineer) to evaluate our job offers. While the companies generally tend to use compensation surveys to set their internal bands, its not always clear where you fall on the band. The leveling across industry is also incredibly varied so it becomes incredibly difficult to think about where you fall. Evaluating your base pay is easiest in locations such as california and new york where employers are now required to post the salary bands for their roles. One option could be to look through the bands for their nearest competitors and see where you fall. Another option is to rely on [h1b data](https://h1bdata.info/index.php?em=merck&job=&city=&year=2023) to get some reference numbers on the salary ranges. A third option is to potentially look through reddit's biotech [salary survey](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G0FmJhkOME_sv66hWmhnZS5qR2KMTY7nzkxksv46bfk/edit) to get an idea. For small startups, usually their base pay is at or below market but they will give you a lot more equity (see below on how to think about that) to compensate. 

### Bonus percentage
Most offers come with a target bonus percentage. This is a lump sum bonus paid annually. The exact value that you get is dependent on several factors including the company's performance, their remaining runway, and your individual performance. The percentage values depend on a variety of factors including company size, your leveling etc. Usually, there is less negotiation room here since these are fixed percentages set for a large number of folks within the company. 

### 401K matching
Several companies might offer a 401K match. What this usually means is that the company will match your 401K contributions up to a certain percentage amount of your base salary as long as you contribute that amount too. Usually there is a cap on the absolute amount (though not always). For example, a company offering a 4% match on a 100K salary could be an additional $4000 added to your 401K tax free. In my opinion, this is a often a great deal. However, I would recommend chatting with your 401K administrator to make sure you can maximize the match amount. 

### Starting bonus/moving expenses 
Usually if you are moving states or are lucky enough to be in a highly required role at the right time, you can negotiate for an additional starting bonus. 

### Perks
The utility of perks really depends on the individual but anything from onsite gym facilities, paid lunches, home setup stipend, public transport stipend, IVF treatment etc can be part of the package. How much each any/each of those matter to you will likely depend on your personal circumstances. For example free breakfast and lunches can be an additional 5-10K if you go into the office everyday or 0 if are fully remote. 

### Equity 
I have left the equity component last because imo it is one of the trickiest things to evaluate. There

## Final thoughts 
Do not accept the first offer you are given! There is almost always wiggle room along several dimensions in every offer given to a candidate. Depending on your needs, status, and seniority, you might be able to negotiate a lot of them.
