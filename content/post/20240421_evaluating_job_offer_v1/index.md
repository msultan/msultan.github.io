## Introduction
Congratulations on getting your new job! It must have been a journey given all the criterion that [you had consider](https://msultan.github.io/post/20240421_job_hunting_p1/) to find this amazing spot. Very likely now you will get an official offer letter that details your offer, and you might start to read things like ISOs or RSUs and 4% 401K match in there. This blog post is a short explanation of what to expect and how to think about whether or not what you are getting is "fair", "poor", or "generous" 

In general, I think its absolutely atrocious that we as an industry do not have something as awesome as [levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/?compare=Google,Facebook,Salesforce&track=Software%20Engineer). I think it removes a lot

## Ways companies might compensate you: 
1. Base pay
2. Bonus percentage
3. Equity 
4. 401K matching 
5. Starting bonus/moving expenses 
6. ESPP  
7. Perks 

## Equity 101

## Final thoughts 
Do not accept the first offer you are given! There is almost always wiggle room along several dimensions in every offer given to a candidate. Depending on your needs, status, and seniority, you might be able to negotiate a lot of them.
