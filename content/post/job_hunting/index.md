## Introduction

After going through a few job hunting cycles in industry, I went back and thought about what it was that I was doing when I 
was job hunting and realized that I probably should have been far more considerate about the criterion that I was consdering. This blog 
is an attempt to summarize my thoughts, experiences, and recommendations with job hunting as a computational scientist in the biotech space. 

## Criterion to consider
We spend a long time of our waking hours at work and I would argue we should be very thoughtful about our career moves. While I could go into detail about many different criterion that you should consider when hunting for a new job, I think

3. Cold emails:

6. Recuriters: As you grow in your career, you will often get interesting recruiters coming your way with new opportunities. Sometimes these could be very intersting opportunities though often they will be offers from your direct rivals
