## Introduction
Navigating your career as a computational scientist requires more than just technical knowledge. Well funded bigtech vs mission oriented biotech vs independence focused academia offer you differing and unique experiences. 

In this post, we will cover the crucial differences between project ownership, functional/cross functional collaboration, managerial roles, data generation, and day to day activities that define these industries. We will also try to cover the wet/dry lab resourcing and how much and what kind of impact your models might produce. 


#### Pro Tip: The views expressed in this post are the opinions of the authors. Please note that there are likely exceptions to each of these topics in each area. Your mileage will vary. 


## Massive table of many things: 
Instead of a long-format comparison between big tech, biotech, and academia, we’ve distilled a table organized around four key themes that capture what you can expect in each of these environments:
1. Collaboration and roles: Who will you collaborate with and what roles will you play? This theme explores team dynamics, project ownership and cross-functional collaboration. 
2. Data management: What type of data will you handle and what tools will you use? Here we cover how you will wrangle with data and what type of support you will receive.
3. Modeling and tasks: What type of models will you deploy and what impact will they have? This theme focuses on the nature of problems you’ll be solving, the methods you’ll employ, and how your work will drive value.
4. Resources and infrastructure: What computing and financial resources will support your work? In this theme we examine how infrastructure, computing resources, and financial stability of your organization affect your projects.

By breaking down these  themes, we aim to provide a clear framework for understanding how your career might unfold across different sectors.

## Summary
Jeff Bezos has a famous framework on [reversible and irreversible decisions](https://fs.blog/reversible-irreversible-decisions/), arguing that reversible decisions should be made quickly, while irreversible ones require careful consideration. Choosing the right place to work falls somewhere in between. We hope that this post serves as a guide to help computational scientists navigate the various facets of career choices in big tech, biotech, and academia. While these might be helpful, remember that [careers are long](https://lethain.com/forty-year-career/), and it's normal to make mistakes or pick the wrong path at times. There will always be new opportunities, and in the end, you will be okay.
